# Hi, I'm Shivani Nikam
I am a Computer Science undergraduate interested in machine learning, computational modelling, and human-centered AI. I enjoy building systems that interpret real-world signals—visual, behavioural, or structural—and applying ML methods to scientific and practical problems.

## Publications
*Hue Match: A Personal Colour Identity System*  
Published in Springer LNNS (Scopus indexed) and presented as an oral talk at AMRIT 2025.  
This work develops a complete computer-vision pipeline for personalised colour analysis, including facial region extraction, RGB-to-HSV transformation, undertone classification, seasonal palette assignment, and real-time recommendation design.

## Current Research Projects
- *Human Perception Simulator*  
  A research-oriented model simulating variations in human colour perception through hue, brightness, and illumination changes, with LAB-space ΔE2000 perceptual analysis and visualisation.

- *Motion Signal Modelling for Early Neurological Screening*  
  Analysing human movement patterns to identify subtle anomalies that may support early disease detection.

- *Graph Neural Networks for Drug Interaction Prediction*  
  Exploring graph-based representations and GNN architectures to model multi-drug interactions and identify potential risks.

## Research Interests
- Computational perception and colour science  
- Computer vision and signal analysis  
- Graph neural networks  
- Machine learning for scientific and medical applications  
- Data-driven modelling of human behaviour and responses  

## Selected Projects
### Hue Match – Personal Colour Identity System  
Published in Springer LNNS (Scopus indexed).  
Implements face detection, colour-space modelling, undertone classification, seasonal palette mapping, and real-time recommendation logic. Designed to support e-commerce and personalised beauty applications.

### Human Perception Simulator  
Models perceptual variations using colour transformations and LAB ΔE metrics. Includes a complete analysis notebook and saved output examples.

### Motion Signal Modelling  
Applies ML techniques to analyse micro-movements for potential neurological anomaly detection.

### Drug Interaction Prediction with GNNs  
Investigates graph-based learning for predicting interactions in multi-drug environments.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced machine learning methods  
- Graph learning and embeddings  
- Scientific Python workflows  
- Experimental design and research writing
