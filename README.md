# Hi, I'm Shivani Nikam
I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate interested in machine learning, computational modelling, and human-centered AI. I enjoy building systems that interpret real-world signals—visual, behavioural, or structural—and applying ML methods to scientific and practical problems.

## Publications
*Hue Match: A Personal Colour Identity System*  
Accepted for publication in Springer LNNS (Scopus indexed) and selected as presenter for an oral talk at AMRIT 2025.  
This work develops a complete computer-vision pipeline for personalised colour analysis, including facial region extraction, RGB-to-HSV transformation, undertone classification, seasonal palette assignment, and real-time recommendation design.

## Current Research Projects
- *Human Perception Simulator*  
  A research-oriented model simulating variations in human colour perception through hue, brightness, and illumination changes, with LAB-space ΔE2000 perceptual analysis and visualisation.

- *Motion Signal Modelling for Early Neurological Screening*  
  Analysing human movement patterns to identify subtle anomalies that may support early disease detection.

- *Graph Neural Networks for Drug Interaction Prediction*  
  Exploring graph-based representations and GNN architectures to model multi-drug interactions and identify potential risks.
